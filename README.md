Overview
This project explores the origins and evolution of galaxies, focusing on classification and analysis using data from the Galaxy Zoo project. Galaxy Zoo, a citizen science initiative, empowers volunteers to classify galaxies based on their shape, size, and other characteristics. The primary motivation for this project is rooted in understanding how galaxies, including our own Milky Way, formed and evolved over time.

The project uses data collected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which provides a detailed view of the universe, enabling classification of over 900,000 galaxies.

Data Sources
The data for this project comes from:

Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS): A comprehensive survey of the sky providing images and spectral data.
Galaxy Zoo API: Used to gather classifications made by volunteers participating in the Galaxy Zoo project.
Project Structure
Data Collection: Using the SDSS and Galaxy Zoo datasets.
Data Processing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Galaxy Classification: Using various machine learning techniques to classify galaxies.
Visualization: Generating visual representations of the classified galaxies.
